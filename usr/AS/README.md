TEST RUN

Download the following files:
* helperEstimateRelativePose.m
* read_image_seq.m
* img

Run the file ```read_image_seq.m``` using MATLAB

Make sure path to images is correct.

The code output is as follows:
* Displays two images used to match features.
* Displays detected features.
* Displays matched features.
* Displays 3D model generated along with camera positions.

**Note: Only 2 images are used to demonstrate in this case so model isn't precise**

You can also run the python code to detect SURF features. This is currently in testing, however if you run the script along with any image it should display SURF points.

```python test_SURF.py```
